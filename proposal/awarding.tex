After the winner is selected, we only announce the winner on Nestor. We propose that it receives a bit more fanfare.

First of all, we'd like to present the award at a staff meeting. Either at the first staff meeting after the winner is chosen, or at the start of the year. Potentially, it could be presented by the previous years winners, as some sort of hand-off ceremony. 

We would also look into announcing the award through channels beyond the Programme Committee Nestor page, such as the Nice-To-Know tab on Nestor.

We would also like to add a more personal touch to the award, beyond a generic prize. For example, \label{interview}, we could conduct a lighthearted short interview, recorded or transcribed, to be put on Nestor. The interview questions could be based on the specific award they won.
