To prevent the same teachers winning every year and to make the award more personal and insightful, we propose that students vote on predefined categories. Thus, instead of being told you are the "best" teacher of the year, you are given a concrete reason as to why you are so popular.

Furthermore, we propose that these categories change every year, and that no two categories repeat within a 3-year time span. The time-period is chosen so that students across a single degree will always see new categories.

The idea behind this decision is that new categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reward different styles of teaching, or even encourage the adoption of new styles.

This does presuppose that a teacher would care about the award, but that's it's own problem to solve.
\item Gives a greater chance that new winners are selected. 
\end{itemize}
