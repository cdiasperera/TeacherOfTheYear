We propose the following changes, to improve the award:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add pre-determined categories which teachers can win.
    \item Directly inform the staff about the award, and involve them more in the awarding process.
    \item Have a more substantial method of presenting the award.
    \item Create a website specifically for the award.
\end{itemize}
