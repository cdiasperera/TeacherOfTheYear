To prevent consecutive winners, we think it would be a good idea to actually have a cooldown period on the winners of an award, possibly for 2 or 4 years\footnote{We choose this period to avoid lecturers being nominated for the same categories of award}:
\begin{itemize}
\item It directly reduces the number of consecutive winners.
\item Good teachers are unlikely to become demotivated just because they are ineligible to win the award, so we do not believe teachers would become worse simply by being ineligible to win.
\item The student body that is voting would have significantly changed, and thus more meaningful to win again, since you are starting your "campaign" from the scratch.
\end{itemize}
