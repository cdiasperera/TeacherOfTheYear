Due to the aforementioned issues, we plan to improve the process. The goals of the new system are thus, in descending order of priority
\begin{enumerate}
\item To make the award actually improve the program, even if indirectly, by creating positive incentives.
\item To make teachers more aware of the teacher of the year award.
\item To make teachers care about the award.
\item To make the winner less predictable (based on past winners).
\item To improve the voting process, in terms of the voters' experience.
\end{enumerate}
